# SafariServices VS WebKit
This respository is a simple project for using WebKit and SafariServices. 
- WebKit is the layout and rendering engine behind Safari on OS X and iOS. It allows to parse and render html, load and display images, and execute JavaScript.
- Using Safari allows you to delegate the responsibility of rendering web content to Safari. In this way, you also write less code than when using a WKWebView.

Learning Switf and Xcode is my passion. This project was built by following the tutorial and source code online.
